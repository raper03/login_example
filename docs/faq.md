## Why did you make this?
This is a homework assignment for my software engineering class at NSU. Not for a grade, but rather an incentive to get this portion of the exam omitted if there is enough submissions showing that there is no need for this to be tested for. I am also strengthening my understanding of Python which is to feed two birds with one seed.
  
## Future plans with this project?
Please check [UPDATES](updates.md). I will be keeping updates there.
